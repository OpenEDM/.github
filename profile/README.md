# OpenEDM

Welcome to **OpenEDM** -- an open-source desktop EDM ([Electrical Discharge Machining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_discharge_machining)) project built by makers, for makers. If you've ever wanted to create your own precision **metalworking machine** suitable for **home use** or just explore the world of EDM, you're in the right place.

## What We're Building

**OpenEDM** is all about creating a compact, affordable EDM machines that anyone can build, modify, and use -- whether you're a hobbyist, engineer, student, or just curious.

We're aiming for a design that’s:

- Easy(ish) to build at home
- Modular and hackable
- Great for learning, experimenting, and real work

## Advantages of EDM Over Traditional Machining

EDM offers some clear advantages over traditional metalworking methods like CNC milling, especially if you're working in places that aren’t exactly machine-shop friendly -- like your apartment:

- **Whisper-quiet** -- No loud spindles or cutting noise. EDM runs almost silently.
- **No flying chips** -- Instead of cutting, EDM erodes material using electric sparks, so you don’t get metal shavings everywhere. Just a small amount of metal particles in the water.
- **Home-friendly** -- Because it's quiet and clean, EDM is much more suitable for indoor use than traditional machining.

There are other advantages as well:

- **Very precise** -- EDM handles fine details and sharp internal corners.
- **No mechanical forces** -- Slow, contactless cutting means the machine doesn’t need a very rigid frame, making it simpler and cheaper to build.
- **Works on any conductive material** -- Hardened tool steel, titanium, tungsten carbide -- EDM cuts them all.

Sure, EDM is slower than milling or turning. But in return, you get clean results, minimal noise, and a workspace that doesn’t look like a metal storm just passed through.
