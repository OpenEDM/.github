# OpenEDM

Welcome to **OpenEDM** -- an open-source desktop EDM ([Electrical Discharge Machining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_discharge_machining)) project built by makers, for makers. If you've ever wanted to build your own precision machining tool or explore the world of EDM, you're in the right place.

## What We're Building

**OpenEDM** is all about creating a compact, affordable EDM machine that anyone can build, modify, and use -- whether you're a hobbyist, engineer, student, or just curious.

We're aiming for a machine that‚Äôs:

- üõ†Ô∏è Easy(ish) to build at home
- üß© Modular and hackable
- üéì Great for learning, experimenting, and real work
